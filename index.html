          <h2>Information Design</h2>
          <p>
            In 7 Poems, the information is organised through a clear spatial
            layout and semantic labelling. Each poem title, such as “The Beetle”
            or “April Showers”, is displayed on a green bar that acts as both a
            navigation element and a thematic cue. This creates a relationship
            between the label and its content, supporting user orientation. Once
            clicked, the poem unfolds one word at a time in the centre of the
            textbox, creating a slow and rhyming information flow. The visual
            hierarchy is clear, with small titles and larger text placed in the
            centre. This helps guide the user’s attention naturally from
            selecting a poem to reading it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Liquid Entropy presents a different design in UI, with a
            more ambiguous interface. A control panel in the top-left side
            includes sliders labelled with abstract terms such as “gleams”,
            “entropy” and “worm”. These lack a functional explanation and rely
            on users to experiment and interpret the results through
            audio-visual showing. Moreover, Liquid Entropy offers an immersive
            experience for users, but the guidance is limited.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, 7 Poems gives clear structure and guidance through titles
            and green bars, while Liquid Entropy focuses on discovery through
            testing and does not give direct instruction.
          </p>
        </section>
        <!--Section Mapping-->
        <section class="info-box mapping">
          <h2>Mapping</h2>

          <p>
            In 7 Poems, the spatial layout of the green bars creates a direct
            and intuitive connection between each interface element and its
            associated poem. Clicking a green bar reveals the text word by word
            alongside ambient audio, while clicking again pauses the sequence.
            This interaction reinforces user control. The mapping is clear,
            especially the position and function of each element, which
            correspond smoothly to its outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            By contrast, Liquid Entropy gives users a more abstract mapping. The
            control panel contains sliders with abstract labels like “gleams”
            and “entropy”, which give no immediate clues about their function.
            Users must guess and discover how each control affects the visuals
            and audio. While this mapping fosters creative exploration, it can
            also hinder usability for first-time users due to the lack of
            affordance and explanatory cues. The relationship between action and
            result is discoverable but not immediately apparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, 7 Poems is easy to understand because the actions and
            results are connected. In contrast, Liquid Entropy uses a more
            experimental style, where the controls are less clear, encouraging
            users to explore and discover the results by themselves.

        <!--Section Characterisation-->
        <section class="info-box character">
          <h2>Characterisation</h2>

          <p>
            In 7 Poems, it uses a soft and yellow colour palette that creates a
            fresh and natural feeling, which matches the themes of the poems.
            The background is simple, allowing the text to stand out. When each
            word of the poem appears, it is matched with a gentle sound, like a
            musical note. This gives each word a sense of rhythm and turns
            reading into a sensory experience. The overall character feels calm,
            thoughtful, and connected to nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, Liquid Entropy uses a very different visual and sound
            style. Its main colours are black, grey and blue, which create a
            futuristic and almost sci-fi mood. The animation has a metallic
            texture, and the movement feels like the flow of energy or entropy.
            When the user adjusts the sliders, the visuals change in real time
            and are matched with metallic and bouncing sounds. The background
            audio is low and electronic, adding to the immersive, industrial
            feeling. The character of Liquid Entropy is experimental, bold and
            highly sensory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the two interfaces create unique atmospheres by using
            different visual and audio choices. 7 Poems focuses on calm
            reflection, while Liquid Entropy creates an intense and futuristic
            experience.
          </p>

        <!--Section Feedback-->
        <section class="info-box feedback">
          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            In 7 Poems, feedback is both visual and auditory, working together
            to confirm user actions and create a poetic atmosphere. Clicking a
            green bar expands a text box with the poem, signalling that the
            section is active. Words appear one by one with a musical note,
            creating a sense of rhythm like playing an instrument. If the text
            box is clicked again, the text and music pause, and the background
            colour turns green to indicate the paused state. Multiple poems can
            be opened at once, causing different melodies to overlap. This
            layered feedback enhances the sensory experience but also can make
            the soundscape more complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Liquid Entropy, feedback is more exploratory. Sliding parameters
            in the control panel causes immediate changes to both visual and
            sound. The metallic textures shift in response, and electronic tones
            alter in pitch or intensity. These actions happen without guidance,
            so users must learn through exploration. In addition, the interface
            includes a “reset params” option, restoring default settings and
            encouraging repeated exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, compared to 7 Poems, where feedback is clear and state
            changes are visually marked, Liquid Entropy focus on sensory
            immersion and encourages user-driven exploration.
